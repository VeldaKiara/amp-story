# amp-story

This project is on creating a webstory using AMP.

Stories have been awfully common in the socials app we use. I wanted to learn about how to create.
I learned about AMP a few years ago, from Ben Morrs though I have not explored it yet till this project.

In this story I used Glitch and a boiler plate from AMP.

The story contains various images of Siberian Huskys, yes dogs. I love dogs especially Huskies.

The story uses animate-in and animate-in-delay features to make it engaging.
