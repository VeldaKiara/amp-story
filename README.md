# amp-story

I have been getting lost on IG stories and decided that it was time to try to learn how to imlement one.

AMP was easy to jump to because I had been introduced to it earlier on by Ben Morss. I always wanted ot use it somewhere and fate was on my side.

I have used the boiler plate provided in their website.

I implemented some animations on the different pages too.

You will also notice that the stories are about Huskies. yeapp, I love Siberian Huskies.
